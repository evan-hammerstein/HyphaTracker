# HyphaTracker

This project is designed to analyze hyphal growth using image processing techniques. It provides tools to process a sequence of images, detect and track hyphal tips, calculate growth metrics, and visualize results. The analysis includes measurements of tip growth rates, branching frequency, spore identification, biomass quantification, and distances to regions of interest (ROIs).
